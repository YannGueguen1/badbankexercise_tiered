# Project Title:
Bad Bank - Refactored Tiered App

# Description/Motivation:
This app is a great way to combine what I have learned so far during this program, as it ties front end with bad end. This is a great way to get some more experience with React as well, which has been one of the tools I have enjoyed using the most!


# Installation Guidelines:
To run the app, you may fork the repository, clone it to your computer, and run node index.js to start it.
Then, simply navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the app for yourself.

You will see at the top of the screen the different options available to you, such as creating an account with the bank, logging in, deposit/withdraw money and view your balance.
